# Automato

## Core Concept

Automation game centered around tomatoes. Players grow and harvest tomatoes and gather resources in order to build machines/systems that help them grow and harvest more tomatoes of more interesting quality.

## Features

- Tomato growing based on common farming sim tropes
  - Tilling, planting, watering, harvesting, etc.
- Automation elements
  - Automation of monotonous farming tasks
  - Resource gathering/management to build machines/systems
  - Processing of resources (including tomatoes) to acquire materials
  - Item pipelining elements
- Tomato varieties and genetics
  - Players can discover more esoteric varieties of tomatoes that survive in different conditions and can be processed into different resources
  - Mechanics of tomato breeding **TBD**. Options discussed are:
     - A tomato plant has a singular type. Two tomato plants are bred and produce several seeds each with a type taken from one of the two parents, with a chance for a special mutation based on the parents
        - E.g. Breeding two normal tomatoes has a chance to produce a heat-resistant tomato. Breeding two heat-resistant tomatoes has a chance to produce an ice-producing tomato.
     - A tomato plant has a genome with a large number of genetic markers for various traits. Two tomato plants are bred and produce several seeds with the seeds’ genomes determined Punnett-square-style from the parents. 
      - Possibility for tomatoes to have many traits/produce many things, and possibility to have players discover tomato traits
- Art style/Vibe

  - Top-down isometric pixel-art. I’m picturing like slightly lower-res stardew valley
  - Silly vibe! It’s a stupid concept and I wanna lean into that!
- Biomes?/Weather?
  - Tomatoes that survive in different climates implies the existence of different climates. **Needs fleshing out.**
- Silly vibe cont.
  - I want the game to be a cool automation game that has just fuck around vibes.
  - Ideas for silly:
     - Rabbits around the world that you can feed tomatoes. Doesn’t do anything. Maybe changes the color of the rabbit based on the variety
     - Tomatoes that produce something ridiculous and not very useful. Like candy corn tomatoes or something. (Maybe you can turn regular tomatoes into candy tomatoes?)
     - Have this image of a traveling salesman who comes by your house every once in a while and sells you wild things in exchange for weird tomatoes?
     - **This will obv be fleshed out**
